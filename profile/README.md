# OpenMeet

OpenMeet is an open-source platform that helps people discover and organize local interest groups, making it easier to build meaningful connections in their neighborhoods, towns, and cities. We believe that tools for bringing people together should be freely available to everyone, which is why we're building OpenMeet in the open, allowing anyone to contribute to and benefit from better community organizing software.

## Mission

We believe that tools for bringing people together should be freely available to everyone, which is why we're building OpenMeet in the open, allowing anyone to contribute to and benefit from better community organizing software.

## Use cases

Following are stories about how we envision OpenMeet being used.

### The Local Artist Community

Sarah, a watercolor artist, wanted to connect with other artists in her neighborhood but found existing platforms too commercial or impersonal. Using OpenMeet, she created a "Portland Urban Sketchers" group. The platform helped her:

- Organize weekly sketching meetups in different city locations
- Share upcoming events with local art enthusiasts
- Build a supportive community of 30+ artists who now regularly meet, share techniques, and collaborate on local exhibitions
- Keep the focus on genuine connections rather than commercial interests

### The Tech for Good Initiative

Marcus, a software developer, was passionate about using technology to solve local community problems. Through OpenMeet, he:

- Started a "Louisville Tech for Good" group
- Connected with other socially conscious developers, designers, and community organizers
- Organized monthly hackathons focusing on local non-profit needs
- Built a network of 50+ tech professionals who now regularly contribute to community projects
- Created real impact by building free websites and apps for local charities
