# OpenMeet

OpenMeet is an open-source platform that helps people discover and organize local interest groups, making it easier to build meaningful connections in their neighborhoods, towns, and cities. We believe that tools for bringing people together should be freely available to everyone, which is why we're building OpenMeet in the open, allowing anyone to contribute to and benefit from better community organizing software.
