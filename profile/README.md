# OpenMeet

OpenMeet is an open-source replacement for Meetup.com, which has raised their prices after being aquired in 2024. The Meetup product raised their rates sky-high. $24 a month to create 3 events. Relieving lonliness shouldn't be expensive.

 The goal is to help people discover and organize local interest groups, making it easier to build meaningful connections in their neighborhoods, towns, and cities. We believe that tools for bringing people together should be freely available to everyone, which is why we're building OpenMeet in the open, allowing anyone to contribute to and benefit from better community organizing software.

## Mission

A platform designed to provide a free, simple way for people to meet in person. We’re offering all the features of the current unaffordable solutions—for free—and are enhancing them with AI to create a complete event solution. Users can easily create, publicize, and even monetize events

Our core mission is simple: “Get Involved.” It’s time to bring people back to face-to-face connections.

## Use cases

### The Tech for Good Initiative

Marcus, a software developer, was passionate about using technology to solve local community problems in his hometown. Through OpenMeet, he:

- Started a "Tech for Good" group
- Connected with other socially conscious developers, designers, and community organizers
- Organized quarterly hackathons focusing on local non-profit needs
- Built a network of 50+ tech professionals who now regularly contribute to community projects
- Created real impact by building free websites and apps for local charities
  
### Monthly Coffee Klatsch

Linda, a retired teacher in Seattle, uses OpenMeet to transform her neighborhood:
- Hosts a monthly coffee meetup that rotates between local cafes
- Started with 4 neighbors, now welcomes 40+ regular attendees
- Creates an inclusive space where newcomers instantly feel at home
- Helps recent transplants build their first local friendships
- Strengthens community bonds through regular face-to-face connections
- Supports local coffee shops by bringing in steady business

What started as a simple idea - "let's meet for coffee" - has become a cornerstone of community life. Members have formed walking groups, book clubs, and even organized neighborhood improvement projects. The ripple effects of these casual conversations over coffee show how simple gatherings can transform a neighborhood into a true community.

"I never expected a monthly coffee meetup could create such meaningful connections," says Linda. "Now I can't walk down the street without running into a friendly face."
